      HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose
      text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default
      characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser,
      and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page
      designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in
      the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in
      turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that
      used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS
      (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting
      commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually
      format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based
      on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely
      print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has
      been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
